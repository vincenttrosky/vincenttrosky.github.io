      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello! Welcome to my project portfolio! I'm Vincent, a mechanical and robotics engineer with a passion for developing complete robotic systems that solve real-world problems. I recently gradauted from Illinois Institute of Technology with a Master's degree in Autonomous Systems and Robotics. I have strong backgrounds in mechanical design, mechatronics, manufacturing, and most recently, robotics software and controls engineering.

My two primary projects right now include (1) a mobile robot capable of SLAM and object-tracking and (2) a mini bipedal limit-cycle walker in the Nonsmooth Robotics Lab at Illinois Tech.
